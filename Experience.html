    <h1>Applications</h1>

    <hr>

    <div class="box">

      <p>As a matter of fact, the reliance on quantum computers has risen greatly
      ever since the beginning of the pandemic. Some companies have used quantum
      computing to better process the huge amounts of data of the COVID-19 pandemic
      than regular computers. Since pandemics are very complex with the nature of
      how they spread and affect supply and demand of business and much more, this
      is an interesting application. Other than that, quantum computing is
      surprisingly useful in a variety of areas and industries. Here are just a few
      interesting ones.</p>

    <h2>Database Searching</h2>

    <p>Have you ever gone to a celebrity’s profile on social media and searched
    through their millions of followers the name of someone in order to find out
    if they follow them? You might get no results, even if it’s not true, and they
    do follow that celebrity. Database searching is a tedious process for a
    classical computer, as it takes the characters that you’ve inputted and has
    to go through every single one in its database to check for a match. Now
    imagine if it has to go through millions, just like the social media example.
    With the exponential processing power of a quantum computer, it can find what
    you’re looking for in a huge database much, much faster, at an estimated
    square root of the original time.</p>

    <h2>Solving Famously-Difficult Mathematical Problems</h2>

    <img src="images/P_vs_NP.jpeg" width="600" alt="A depiction of problems that fit in either category of the P vs NP problem." class="floatLeft">

    <p>A funny and popular use for quantum computers is one not quite so noble. It
    involves ruining security system technologies currently being used by
    practically the entire world, destroying privacy as we know it. Data such as
    browsing history, emails, banking data, credit card details, and other
    personal classified information is kept secure by an encryption system that
    keeps it all secure by you owning a public key that only you can decode.
    Decrypting it is so insanely difficult because they involve gigantic prime
    numbers that need to be factorized. This is related to the P vs NP problem, a
    famously difficult mathematical problem that still hasn’t been solved today.
    In a nutshell, the question posed is, “Once you have the answer to a hard
    problem, it is easy to quickly check if it is right. But does this also mean
    that the problem itself can also be solved just as quickly?” Problems in NP
    have answers that are easy to check. A subcategory in NP is P, which are problems
    that have answers that are easy to check, and they are fairly quick to find the
    answer for. The question is, does P = NP? Are all problems in NP, in fact, also
    in P? Or are there problems that are truly so hard that we can check an answer
    easily if they're correct for them, but we don't have any good way of solving
    the problem quickly? For example, checking if two prime numbers are factors of
    another big prime is easy. Just multiply them and check. However, does this also
    mean finding those two factors is just as easy when given only the big prime? As
    we already know, seemingly it’s no. Which is why encryption systems around the
    world still work. Safety in numbers. But we cannot know for sure. A quantum
    computer can challenge that idea and finally solve the P vs NP problem (if you
    solve it you get a million dollars from the Clay Institute of Mathematics). Even if you
    build faster computers to factorize these numbers, it can be easily countered
    by the system just multiplying bigger numbers into even larger prime numbers.
    A quantum computer, however, can use a factorization method so devastatingly
    fast due to the way it computes things (all at once) that their invention
    could spark a security information crisis. Imagine an organization getting
    their hands on a quantum computer to decrypt all the world’s secrets! Using
    its power to transfer money from bank accounts to theirs! Decrypting nuclear
    launch codes! Quantum computers have the possibility to be extremely dangerous
    as much as revolutionary.</p>

    <h2>Complex Simulations</h2>

    <img src="images/the_matrix.jpeg" width="500" alt="A poster for The Matrix film." class="floatRight">

    <p>There is a saying that goes something like, “A flap of a butterfly’s wings
    in (insert place here) can cause a tornado in (insert another faraway place
    here).” This is based on chaos theory, a mathematical theory that’s fairly
    complex in its own right because it tries to explain the nature of complex
    systems such as our planet. That tiny things like butterflies can cause huge
    changes to the environment that are drastically different from initial
    conditions through complicated processes. It’s the reason why weather is
    sometimes so unpredictable, no matter how good our technology is. With the
    computational power of quantum computers, perhaps we can tackle this challenge
    head-on by simulating them with one. Imagine a quantum computer simulating an
    environmental weather system so complicated and down to every last detail that
    it can predict if a certain butterfly’s flap of the wings will cause it to
    rain today. This is an aim quantum computers are being made for, and while we
    haven’t done any huge-scale simulations like this yet, theoretically they’d be
    able to. They’d be able to simulate the quantum world so we can better
    understand the history and nature of the universe, perhaps tying in Einstein’s
    general theory of relativity with our current understanding of space. They’d
    be able to model complex molecules and proteins with incredible accuracy that
    could revolutionize medicine and innovate health technology. They’d be able to
    help astronauts simulate rockets and gravity in space and therefore aid in space
    exploration. The possibilities are endless. In theory, this would be the
    greatest purpose of quantum computers.</p>

    <h2>Other Uses For Quantum Computers</h2>

      <li>Financial Modeling</li>
      <li>Better Batteries</li>
      <li>Cleaner Fertilization</li>
      <li>Traffic Optimization</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Solar Capture</li>
      <li>Electronic Materials Discovery</li>
      <li>Machine Learning</li>
      <li>Computational Biology</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Quantum computers are only faster than classical computers when doing
    tasks that require numerous calculations to be done in parallel. If you want
    to watch puppy or kitten videos on YouTube or write an essay, classical
    computers are much better suited for the task. However, if you want to find
    one item in a list of a million items, a quantum computer can do so
    exponentially faster than a classical computer who would have to analyze each
    item one by one.</p>

    <h2>Companies</h2>

    <p>Many tech companies are investing and researching quantum computers,
    pushing the frontiers of the field further than ever before. They are moving
    it out of the academic world and into the world of application, turning it
    from a theoretical science into usable and efficient technology. As quantum
    computers advance faster and faster, only time will tell if they will prove
    to be worthy of their dreamed-of computational impeccability. Here are a few
    companies pursuing this dauntless task.</p>

    <h3>Atom Computing</h3>

    <p>Founded in 2018, Atom Computing creates quantum computer hardware. They
    specialize in neutral atom quantum computers (using atom energy levels for
    qubits). Their projects are still mostly prototypes. Ben Bloom, founder and
    CEO of the company, said it will provide cloud access "to large numbers of
    very coherent qubits by optically trapping and addressing individual atoms.”
    </p>

    <h3>Xanadu</h3>

    <p>Xanadu is a Canadian quantum computing technology company. They aim to
    build quantum computers that are useful and available to people everywhere,
    to commercialize and normalize it. It was founded in 2016. They want to build
    a universal quantum computer using silicon photonic hardware, according to
    Sepehr Taghavi, corporate development manager. They also have a Xanadu Quantum
    Cloud (XQC) service, hosting a server where people can use their quantum
    computers for application purposes.</p>

    <h3>IBM</h3>

    <p>Yes, one of the most well-known computer parts manufacturers and literally
    the world’s oldest computer company also focuses a lot on developing quantum
    computing technology. In 2016, they were the first company to put a quantum
    computer on the cloud with 260,000 registered users. IBM scientists aim to
    create a quantum computer with a 1,121 qubit processor by 2023, which will be
    a 10 foot tall “super fridge.” According to the company this will be capable
    of delivering a “Quantum Advantage,” a point where it can do tasks more
    efficiently than a classical supercomputer. Essentially they mean to prove
    quantum supremacy.</p>

    <h3>Google</h3>

    <p>In 2019, Google along with NASA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory claimed
    to achieve quantum supremacy by calculating something in seconds that even the
    most advanced supercomputers would take thousands of years to do. This is a
    huge milestone for the advancement of the information age and could
    revolutionize computers forever. However it was met with a lot of controversy
    whether they truly reached quantum supremacy or not. A lot of the feud
    happened with IBM, a big rival of Google when it comes to commercializing
    quantum computing. IBM questioned their achievement and whether it was really
    that big or not.</p>
