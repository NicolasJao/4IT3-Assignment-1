      <p>Quantum physics is possibly one of the most difficult subjects to
      understand in the entire universe. It is so fundamentally weird and unorthodox
      in nature that we don’t completely understand it yet, and it has even stumped
      some of the brightest minds in history. Although we don’t understand most of
      the reasoning behind a lot of quantum mechanics, we know they exist and we use
      them and study them. This is why even though most of how a quantum computer
      works will not be understood, we know they will work because we have studied
      how we can use quantum properties to make them work. The quantum world is one
      that creates the basis of our universe, explaining the tiniest things in
      existence and how they behave in reaction to things like matter and forces.
      Since particles are so tiny, it is almost impossible to study what goes on in
      the quantum world. This is why some quantum properties scare us, make us
      question all of classical physics, and disturbs us about the true nature of
      reality. But we use them to our advantage the best we can. Here are a few of
      them that help explain quantum computers better.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Physics Concepts Used</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Qubits</h3>

    <img src="images/bit_vs_qubit.jpeg" width="400" alt="A bit vs a qubit." class="floatLeft">

    <p>Qubits are subatomic particles such as electrons or photons that replace
    classical bits for the smallest units of information for a quantum computer.
    Their properties are measured to produce values of 0 or 1 as binary digits do
    as well. However, quantum properties of these particles allow them to have
    more computing power than can ever be possible on a regular computer. Two of
    these properties are called superposition and entanglement.</p>

    <h3>Superposition</h3>

    <img src="images/superposition.png" width="400" alt="A qubit in superposition." class="floatRight">

    <p>While classical bits can either be 0 or 1 at any time, qubits can be 0 and
    1 simultaneously. The ability to be in multiple states at the same time is
    called superposition. The reason this can happen all comes down to how
    particles behave at the quantum level. They behave like waves. Think of it
    like this. There are two waves on the ocean. Each is distinct in their own
    state and form. However, they can come together and overlap each other to form
    a new bigger wave. This, itself, is also its own distinct state and form.
    Another key thing is that when qubits are measured for their information, they
    will “collapse” to either one of the states 0 and 1. This means their final
    calculation results snap back to normal states we can observe, but only when
    they are done calculating. If the new big wave is both tiny waves at the same
    time, once we surf on it, it will immediately turn into one of the two smaller
    waves. If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is.</p>

    <h3>Entanglement</h3>

    <img src="images/entanglement.jpeg" width="400" alt="An illustration of quantum entanglement." class="floatLeft">

    <p>A pair of qubits that exist in a single quantum state are said to be
    “entangled.” The traits of this property are phenomenally weird but
    interesting. If the state of one qubit is changed, it will instantaneously
    change the other’s state, no matter how far apart the two are. The furthest
    scientists have tested the distance this works is a few hundred kilometres,
    but theoretically, there is no limit. Yes, even light years away this will
    happen. This also means that if we interact with one entangled qubit, we can
    easily predict or deduce the properties of the other entangled qubit. The
    explanation for this quantum property is not quite so simple, for it has even
    baffled scientists themselves. Even Einstein called it “spooky action at a
    distance.” Quantum computers also depend on this property to exponentially
    increase their computing power over classical computers. The ability to
    instantaneously know the outcome of entangled qubits allows it to increase
    the speed of its calculations with specially designed quantum algorithms.</p>

    <h3>Decoherence</h3>

    <img src="images/decoherence.jpeg" width="500" alt="A qubit losing its quauntum superposition state after decoherence." class="floatRight">

    <p>There is a quantum property that creates a drawback for quantum computers,
    though. Qubits aren’t perfect, and how they react with the environment causes
    possibilities for them to lose their quantum state, and therefore the quantum
    properties that make the computer work. This is called decoherence. Since
    their quantum state is extremely fragile, tiny changes in vibrations or
    temperature may cause the qubits to lose their quantum states. This is the
    reason why quantum computers have huge chambers that supercool them or suspend
    them in an isolated vacuum. They must protect the qubits from the outside
    world from interrupting their work before they are done. This is a big problem
    that hinders the progress of quantum computers, which scientists are primarily
    figuring out with smart quantum algorithms to prevent them or by simply making
    more qubits. However, generating qubits is hard, and scientists haven’t been
    able to generate more than 128 standard ones yet (although IBM claims they
    will make a quantum computer with over 1000 by 2023). This is why no quantum
    computer can defeat the best supercomputers yet. Unless the problems with
    decoherence and the ability to generate more qubits gets tackled and perhaps
    solved later on, the era of quantum computing will be delayed.</p>

    <h3>Quantum Gates</h3>

    <img src="images/common_quantum_gates.png" width="500" alt="Common quantum gates and their names." class="floatLeft">

    <p>In classical computers, logic gates are data processors that take a set of
    inputs and give back one definite output. All parts of the process are
    conspicuous and literal. However, a quantum gate is a logic gate of a quantum
    computer that works differently due to qubit manipulation. The input a quantum
    gate takes in is a bunch of superpositions, and as the function happens all it
    does inside is rotate probabilities of the superpositions, and then the output
    is also a bunch of superpositions, but with changed probabilities of outcomes
    for the qubits to become 0 or 1. A quantum computer basically sets up qubits
    and uses quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate their quantum
    properties, and then it finalizes them into a string of 0s and 1s we can read
    as the answer. What does this mean? It means we can calculate all the possible
    calculations we can do with the inputs all at once. Imagine if you have a set
    of data that you need to go through the logic gate, and you need each input to
    get each output one after the other. Instead, you can throw all the inputs in
    the quantum gate at once and it will manipulate them to get all the outputs.
    Unlike classical logic gates, quantum gates are even reversible, and just as
    logic gates are to conventional computers, they are the building blocks of
    quantum circuits in a quantum computer. Classical bits are either 0 or 1,
    therefore representing their values results in just saying 0 or 1. However,
    since qubits are in superposition, you must represent their values in a
    matrix (plural matrices). The identity matrix is the base value of a qubit
    and it is depicted as an array of I = [[1,0][0,1]]. 1 and 0 at the same time
    or 0 and 1 at the same time. Of course, this is only before they are
    measured. Otherwise, when observed, they will immediately choose to be 0 or
    1 in a definite manner.</p>

    <h3>Quantum Tunneling</h3>

    <img src="images/quantum_tunneling.jpeg" width="500" alt="A hill analogy that explains quantum tunneling." class="floatRight">

    <p>Quantum tunneling isn’t a property that makes quantum computers work,
    however it is one that has caused us to try to create them due to problems
    it causes with classical computers. It is the phenomenon of subatomic
    particles acting like waves and passing through barriers. When our transistors
    get too small and this starts happening with electrons, it messes up our
    computers and the information they had could be lost forever. It is one of the
    reasons our classical computers cannot get any smaller than they are already
    and therefore cannot fit more transistors to become more powerful. How does it
    happen? In classical physics, a ball requires energy to be pushed up and over
    a hill. However, in quantum physics, the rules are different. Think about it,
    we're talking about the smallest things in existence. Within atoms themselves
    is mostly empty space (no matter), and if things are small enough, like let's
    say an electron, there's always a probability they can squeeze through that
    empty space. It's just when we observe things on the human-scale, we think
    it's impossible to phase through solid matter because of how big we are and
    how tightly packed atoms are in our perspective and world. Quantum tunneling
    has been observed in things such as radioactive decay and is real, defined by
    the probability subatomic particles acting like waves has to "tunnel" through
    matter.</p>
