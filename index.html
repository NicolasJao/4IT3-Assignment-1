    <h2>Nicolas Jao</h2>
    <img src="biopicNico.jpg" width="500" alt="A biopic of Nicolas Jao." class="floatRight">
    <p>I was born in the Philippines and grew up in Aurora, Ontario, but I also have Chinese 
    ancestry. I am currently studying at McMaster University in Hamilton, in a specialized 
    automation engineering co-op program. I have a ton of family (you know us Filipinos) 
    and I do anything and everything with mine. I'm doing my best to make them proud!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am passionate about writing fiction in the form of short stories and novels 
    (check out my <a href="https://nicolasjao.github.io/">portfolio</a>), and naturally that makes me a big reader as well. I love 
    eating food, watching movies, basketball, playing the piano, learning card magic to 
    impress my friends, and I am a massive dog person despite not having a dog (the 
    obsession is out of hand at this point).</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a huge nerd about everything! In my spare time or while I'm eating my 
    meals, you'll likely find me watching YouTube videos about anything from geography, 
    history, philosophy, economics, technology, or even quantum physics. Funny, I know. 
    Learning about the world is my lifetime hobby and I want to know of everything 
    that exists to broaden my global perspective. I'll often explain niche things 
    about a specific culture or a relatively unknown scientific fact to my friends 
    (leaving them amazed hopefully, but more often than not, confused).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Despite wanting to be a world-renowned author as a kid, I've entered the 
    world of engineering. I picked up solid programming skills from high school, CAD 
    and electrical skills from an FRC team, and I know and hang out with a lot of cool 
    and nerdy people. I've always found robots to be awesome (who doesn't, really), 
    and designing them for a career was something I was always sure of about myself. 
    Recently though, I've been learning about PLCs and the automation industry in my 
    classes and have been getting heavily interested in that as well. Perhaps doing 
    something related to both, such as being a controls programmer for industrial 
    manufacturing robots and PLCs, would be the best way to describe my dream job. 
    Especially one that sends me to different countries, wherever our customers are, 
    to travel the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I enjoy meeting similar people and hearing new perspectives. Feel free to 
    contact me to talk about the tech industry, the next year the 
    Toronto Raptors are going to win the championship, or to send me a video of 
    a funny dog.</p>
