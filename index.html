    <h2>Nicolas Jao</h2>
    <img src="biopicNico.jpg" width="500" alt="A biopic of Nicolas Jao." class="floatRight">
    <p>I was born in the Philippines and grew up in Aurora, Ontario. I am currently 
    studying at McMaster University in Hamilton, in a specialized automation engineering 
    co-op program. I have a ton of family (you know us Filipinos) and I do anything 
    and everything with mine. I'm doing my best to make them proud!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am passionate about writing fiction in the form of short stories and novels 
    (check out my portfolio), and naturally that makes me a big reader as well. I love 
    eating food, watching movies, basketball, playing the piano, learning card magic to 
    impress my friends, and I am a massive dog person despite not having a dog (the 
    obsession is out of hand at this point).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Despite wanting to be a world-renowned author as a kid, I've entered the 
    world of engineering. I picked up solid programming skills from high school, CAD 
    and electrical skills from an FRC team, and I know and hang out with a lot of cool 
    and nerdy people. I've always found robots to be awesome (who doesn't, really), 
    and designing them for a career was something I was always sure of about myself. 
    Recently though, I've been learning about PLCs and the automation industry in my 
    classes and have been getting heavily interested in that as well. Perhaps doing 
    something related to both, such as being a controls programmer for industrial 
    manufacturing robots and PLCs, would be the best way to describe my dream job. 
    Especially one that sends me to different countries, wherever our customers are, 
    to travel the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I enjoy meeting similar people and hearing new perspectives. Feel free to 
    contact me via LinkedIn to talk about the tech industry, the next year the 
    Toronto Raptors are going to win the championship, or to send me a video of 
    a funny dog.</p>

    <h2>The (Possible) Solution</h2>

    <p>The answer is Quantum Computing. It is an experimental but very
    scientifically real idea that uses specific properties and concepts of quantum
    physics to perform tasks of orders of magnitude much greater than any
    classical computer. The machines that use quantum computing are called quantum
    computers. Though complex, with enough research and testing, quantum computers
    are very quickly leaving the world of science fiction and entering reality.
    These supposed supercomputers will be able to simulate weather with
    unbelievable accuracy, model molecular structures down to each protein,
    calculate deep space travel routes while incorporating all possible scenarios.
    But what exactly are they? How do they use quantum physics to do things
    classical computers can’t? How do they work? For that, we’re going to need a
    little bit of a history lesson about computers.</p>

    <h2>Classical Computers</h2>

    <img src="images/computer_parts.png" width="600" alt="An illustration of the tiny parts that make up a computer
    (credit: Kursgesagt YouTube)." class="floatLeft">

    <p>“Classical computers” here will refer mostly to computers as they are
    today. Classical computers are made up of a bunch of many tiny parts that do
    different simple tasks, which altogether combine to do practically anything.
    For example, a circuit chip is made up of modules, each module has logic
    gates, and each logic gate consists of the simplest form of a data processor
    in a computer, transistors. What is a transistor, and what is its job? A
    transistor is basically a switch that controls the flow of data or information
    which comes in the form of a bunch of electrons. Since a transistor can be in
    two distinct states, open and closed, it can give two types of information,
    which machines read as either 0 or 1, called bits. This is where we hit our
    problem. Transistors are already reaching the limits of the smallest they can
    be. As mentioned previously, some are capable of being as small as a single
    atom. And on top of that, if transistors get too small, electrons might be
    capable of doing a process called “Quantum Tunneling” where they simply phase
    through the gate of the transistor, messing up the system and ruining the
    information, corrupting the data forever. In order to reach higher levels of
    computing power, we can’t look any further into hardware. Instead, we must
    look into the quantum realm, the world of the tiniest things in existence and
    the strange nature of how they work: particles. Quantum computers promise to
    solve this problem of hardware limitation by changing the bits of information
    being used themselves. Instead of using classical bits which can either be 0
    or 1, quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same
    time! This raises the amount of traditional computing power exponentially.
    How? Quantum computers are able to calculate many different outcomes to a
    problem at the same time, while classical computers have to do so one at a
    time, one after the other. This is why no matter how fast you can make a
    classical computer at doing its tasks, quantum computers will always be
    faster. For example, let’s perceive a string of four bits, each one either 0
    or 1. The string of four bits, also called a “nibble,” can have 2^4 possible
    different values, in other words, 16. And at any given moment, you can only
    use one of them, since classical bits can ever only be either 0 or 1. This is
    where the magic of qubits comes in. If qubits can be 0 and 1 at the same time
    (this is done via a process called superposition), only becoming either one of
    them when we need them to, then we can use all 16 possibilities of a nibble at
    once. Suddenly, our computing power is 16 times more powerful than before. 
    Finally, you can have two chrome tabs open at once!</p>

    <h2>Information</h2>

    <img src="images/information_age.jpeg" width="600" alt="A hand holding a hologram of various types of media." class="floatRight">

    <p>Starting from the middle of the twentieth century, we are currently in what
    is widely known as the “Information Age.” What describes our current era of
    humanity and civilization is information and how we interact with it. Digital
    media, technology, news, the internet, and our access to all of it is a
    defining characteristic of our generation. It is said that the Information Age
    is very closely related to the development of transistor technology. Why is
    that? In fact, what is information? At least, the one we’re talking about? At
    its very core, information is anything that can resemble something that can be
    interpreted and manipulated into what we want it to do or say. In computers,
    bits are the tiniest pieces of information, but physically they consist of
    electrons running through transistors controlling their flow. In a nutshell,
    transistors control their flow and therefore voltage, and different levels of
    voltage give a signal of two values. In the case of bits, these two values are
    0 and 1. These values of 0 and 1 are then interpreted by the computer through
    their own processing language called machine code, the technically
    lowest-level programming language. Machine code is the language that our
    compilers turn our programming code into when we program computers with
    languages we actually can work with and understand such as Python and Java.
    However, information doesn’t have to come in the physical form of electrons
    and their voltage. In quantum computers, information still comes in two
    values, but they come in the physical form as the properties of particles,
    such as the spin and magnetic field of a subatomic particle, or a photon’s
    horizontal and vertical polarization. These properties are measured by the
    quantum computer, processed as machine code, and converted into whatever task
    the computer needs to do. That’s where the possibilities of quantum physics
    come in. In the quantum world of particles, the rules of physics are weirder
    than ever before. For example, an electron orbiting an atom has a position and
    a momentum. However, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, you cannot
    measure both at the same time. If you locate its position, you cannot know its
    momentum, and if you measure its momentum, you cannot know its position. So,
    instead, electrons exist in a cloud of probability of where they could be.
    Scientifically, these are called orbitals. This two-way quantum system is
    similar to superposition which is why qubits can be two distinct states at the
    same time, which will be explained later. Instead of being limited by the
    rules of the quantum world by not being able to make computers any smaller,
    scientists are using the rules and properties of quantum physics to their
    advantage. These rules and properties will be explained further in the second
    page of this website, in, “How They Work.”</p>

    <h2>Quantum Supremacy</h2>

    <img src="images/quantum_supremacy.jpeg" width="500" alt="A quantum computer in a lab." class="floatLeft">

    <p>As you know now, quantum computers use the properties of particles, their
    nature, and quantum physics to perform tasks much better and faster than any
    classical computer. Right now, it’s a very experimental subject that still
    needs further research on. However, it is quickly becoming viable and will
    definitely be a technology that will exist in the near future. The hardest
    part of creating a quantum computer is generating qubits. As mentioned before,
    qubits exist physically as subatomic particles with properties we measure that
    can be converted into computer information. Some companies cool circuits to
    temperatures near absolute zero to create them. Some trap atoms in magnetic
    fields in ultra-vacuum chambers. This is why pictures you see of quantum
    computers are typically huge, wiry, complicated messes and chambers. They look
    really complicated, but the goal is simple. In the end the goal of a quantum
    computer is to isolate the qubits in a controlled quantum state that we can
    manipulate and measure. Okay, maybe not so simple. The idea of quantum
    supremacy is proving that quantum computers will be able to perform tasks
    classical computers can’t. As of right now, there isn’t a task given to them
    that classical computers can’t do. But as they get better and better, quantum
    computers will surely be able to beat their conventional counterparts. Will
    they replace regular computers? It’s hard to say. Some scientists think they
    will, and they are the future of computational technology. Others think we’ll
    mostly still use classical computers, and quantum computers will be
    specialized for the super hard computational tasks, such as simulating
    environments as big as a planet to as small as a human body, or helping
    astronauts travel deep space. Though quantum computers look vastly different
    than traditional computers, sharing practically no hardware or engineering at
    all, they both fundamentally function the same: aiding humanity in calculating
    tasks that our monkey brains would not be able to do themselves. It’s just,
    out of the two, quantum computers will be much better and faster at it.</p>
