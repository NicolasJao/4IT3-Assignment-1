    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>I'm a speculative fiction author whose stories often include elements of Chinese or Filipino culture.
    I like writing about the ways new technologies impact our world, as well as how our roots and traditions
    shape us today. I like to tie speculative concepts to deeply human stakes and use speculative elements to
    amplify emotional truths, leaving readers thinking long after the last line.
